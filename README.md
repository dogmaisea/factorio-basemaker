Factorio Base Maker by Dogmai
- DogmaiSEA || Dogmai - South East Asia (Servers)

A collection of commonly used blueprints that can be used on any type of base build, at any point in the game.

## The Concept

The idea behind this book is to have a simple and easy to use blueprint book that can help both new and veteran Factorio players - consider it a "quality of life" blueprint book.

Over the past few years, I have spent a great deal of time on public Factorio servers, often hopping from server to server to help new players in the early to mid-game, as my Gen 1 i7 computer struggles with Factorio in the end-game.

I have witness firsthand the confusion by new players in attempting to create their own base designs that were needed, but not included in the end-game blueprint book that they had downloaded.

This issue was replaying in my mind for a while; what if we split base design into it's most compact but repeatable "building blocks" that could be arranged like a simple jigsaw puzzle, regardless of the style of base design that the player is seeking to create.

This blueprint book is the realisation of my attempt to help fix this issue.

## Learning how to build your own Designs

It is my dream that this Blueprint Book becomes one of the best "stepping stones" available for newer players, who just need a little bit of a nudge in the right direction without having to rely on complicated end game blueprint books, that they probably won't be able to comprehend how it works, why it was designed the way it was, or most importantly, how to fix the design when something goes wrong.

This Blueprint Book should allow players to stop and think about why we (blueprint designers) design things the way they are, and to hopefully allow them to come up with their own designs, in their own style.

This Blueprint Book has been carefully designed to allow you to quickly scale up a design, by simply holding down and dragging and having the boundary boxes for the grid size being correct.

If you see a design with two different tiers of input belt, stop for a moment and think about why that is.

**Spoiler:** Using ***Robot Frames*** as an example; the input required is 1x Steel, 2x Battery, 3x Green Circuit and 1x Electric Engine. Therefore, the Battery and Green Circuits should be split on the higher tiered belt, and the Steel and Eletric Engine split on the lower tier belt.


## Blueprint Book Explanation

### Early Game Smelters

A collection of early game smelters that I prefer, split into final output potential.


### Mid Game Smelters

A collection of mid game electric smelters that I prefer, split into final output potential.


### End Game Smelters

A collection of end game beaconed electric smelters, borrowed from people far smarter than myself, but with their designs sharpened or tidied up a bit by myself.

Like most Factorio players, I have a certain "design style" that I default to when making my own designs, this is evident in the changes I made to these Smelters.


### Miners

A collection of miners to take you all the way from early to late game, without the Space Age expansion.

These Miners are labelled in "Stages", indicating in which order they should be built, depending on which stage of the game you are at.


### Wall Designs and Solar

A collection of different defensive wall designs that I commonly use.

***Flamer Spacing*** is my preferred spacing, I would place this one down first, then the other wall designs in front of it, leaving a one tile gap.

The included "perfect ratio" Solar Designs are my own design.

The Solar Radar is an amazing little build that I stole from a random public server one day, if you know who made it let me know.


### Hotbar Planners

A collection of quality of life Upgrade and Deconstruction Planners that I designed and tested through-out many play-throughs.

Feel free to edit these or add your own, that is what they are there for.


### EXAMPLE: Main Bus

A pre-built Main Bus "starter", that allows for scaling to "Blue Belts" without rearranging the smelter columns.

The included 4-4 thoughput unlimited lane balancers are the correct balancers to use after smelting columns.

This would be the "go-to" initially placed design for most public multiplayer servers.


### Read Me's

I have included several read me's in the Blueprint Book in order to maintain a player's immersion within the game, and without needing to look up a website for commonly asked questions.


### Standard Power and Condensed Power

The included ***Standard Power*** is the most space efficient design for early game power plants.

The included ***Condensed Power*** is my own design, based upon a memory I have of seeing something similar pasted down in a public multiplayer server one day.

I have only been able to find one public posting of that design, but it is not as "clean" as the design I came up with.

I am not the original creator, but this is my personal take on the idea.


### A, B and A + B Designs

Some designs are labelled as A, B and A + B; this means there are two belts on the output side, and in order to "double up" the design, two different parts (A and B) need to be used so the output belt is correct.

An example of this would be Green Circuits.


### All other repeatable block based Designs

These are the smallest repeatable designs I could think of.

Any designs that are larger than a 2x2 assembler design are larger because they are a "perfect ratio", such as; Red Ammunition and Train Tracks.
